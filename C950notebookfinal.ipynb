The pre-sort would likely not work as well for a randomized, larger, or smaller list of packages. Besides this, the rest of the program is designed to accommodate different numbers of deliveries and different destinations. As long as the proper csv files are uploaded and the pre-sort is optimized, the program will work well for a significantly different set of circumstances. This is due to the fact that the process used to generate truck lists utilizes the number of rows in the Package List csv file to create a sufficient number of package objects and load them onto trucks.\n",

This is due to a single sort with a runtime of N\\*log(N), while the rest of the program has a time complexity of O(N). The program's efficiency comes in part from my avoidance of nested for-loops. I was able to reduce the complexity of my main greedy algorithm to O(N) by ensuring that all packages with identical destinations were already loaded onto the same truck before the optimization, saving me a round of comparisons per package. The sort gave me O(NlogN) time, whereas if I had used comparisons to dynamically adjust the statuses of each package it would take O(N^2).\n",
